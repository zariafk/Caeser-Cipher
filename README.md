# __Caeser cipher program with GUI__
#### _Purpose:_ encrypts/decrypts user string input
#### _How it works:_ allows user to select whether they want to encrypt/decrypt. It then allows the user to input text and applies a relevant function to encrypt/decrypt user input. The ciphertext/plaintext is displayed.
#### _Future development plans:_ improve GUI, wrap around text for large text input/output (may include adding character count limitations), back button on windows that are not the initial window screen
